      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
        pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use
        such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
        <a href="#cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cookies are small bits of data that a site or its service provider transfers
        to your computer through your browser that enables the site or service provider
        to recognize your browser and remember certain information about you. We may
        use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixel tags, ad tags and
        web beacons) to collect information to help us understand your interactions
        with the Sites, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed,
        search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. Third
        parties that support the Sites by serving advertisements or providing services,
        such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate usage statistics,
        (e.g., Google Analytics tracking and Google AdWords) may also use these
        technologies to collect similar information. We do not control these
        third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies
        of the third parties using such technologies. Your browser may permit
        you to disable these technologies. However, doing so may prevent you
        from using certain parts of the Sites.

        placed by third party advertising networks. They remember the websites you
        visit and that information is shared with other parties such as advertisers.

        identifiable information and are only used to track the effectiveness of
        a particular campaign.

      <p>
        We may also use web beacons or similar technology to learn whether

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
        for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention
        period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
        requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal
        information for longer than 1 year.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
        information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible
        (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
        archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
        from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <p class="h5">
        <strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
        SAFE?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
        internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
        personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Sites is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure
        environment.

        are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
        dependent's use of the Sites. If we learn that personal information from
        users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
        account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
        records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under
        age 18, please contact us at kliegmandesign@gmail.com.

        <strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
        include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate
        to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
        currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
        for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
        Policy.
